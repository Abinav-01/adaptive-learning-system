Recall\nthat if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of\nthe polynomial p(x).

Then, putting x = 2 in the\npolynomial, we get p(2) = 22 – 3 × 2 – 4 = – 6. The value ‘– 6’, obtained by replacing\nx by 2 in x2 – 3x – 4, is the value of x2 – 3x – 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of\np(x) at x = 0, which is – 4.\nIf p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by\nreplacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k).\nWhat is the value of p(x) = x2 –3x – 4 at x = –1?
